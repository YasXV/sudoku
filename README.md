## THE SUDOKU GENERATOR/SOLVER 

### As a fan of sudoku, who plays almost daily, I wanted to challenge myself by implementing a sudoku generator/solver in c. 

#### Sructures: 

- 1) implementing a table stucture (3x3)
- 2) implementing a sudoku table structure, that contains n x n tables (structure defined earlier).
- 3) Filling with 0 by default
- 4) implementif the display function of the tables and the sudoku grid (the sudoku display will call the display function of the type table)

#### Fill the grid
